This research presents a framework to address the critical challenges of privacy-preserving and secure data sharing in the healthcare industry, particularly in medical image analysis. This framework provides robust security while maintaining high classification accuracy and minimizing computational overhead by integrating a novel learnable encryption method based on block-pixel operation with the Vision Transformer (ViT). The key innovation lies in creating unique scrambling patterns for each encryption key, ensuring that sensitive medical data remains secure, even when processed on cloud-based platforms.

The impact of this research on the healthcare industry is profound, particularly for hospitals and medical institutions that rely on cloud infrastructure for data processing and analysis. Secure data sharing becomes paramount with the increasing need for collaboration among healthcare providers. This framework allows hospitals to securely share and analyze medical images on the cloud, such as MRI scans and histological data, without compromising patient privacy or data integrity. The ability to withstand adversarial attacks, including bit-flip, Gaussian blur, and Gaussian noise, further enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of the system.

For hospitals, adopting this framework translates into enhanced data security, reduced risk of data breaches, and the ability to leverage powerful cloud-based analytical tools without sacrificing performance. The frameworkâ€™s efficiency in handling encrypted data also means that hospitals can achieve faster processing times, leading to quicker and more accurate diagnoses and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

This research is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), reflecting its significance and potential to revolutionize how medical data is shared and analyzed in the healthcare industry. By fostering secure collaboration and leveraging cloud interfaces, this project paves the way for a more connected and secure healthcare ecosystem, where data privacy and patient security are prioritized alongside clinical accuracy and efficiency.
